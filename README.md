# E2E Tests — QA Automation Code Challenge – Playwright (JS/TS)

End-to-end tests for the [QA Practice](https://qa-practice.netlify.app/auth_ecommerce) web app, covering the full user journey from login to order submission.

## What Is Tested

| # | Suite | Tests |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | **Happy Flow** | Add item to cart and submit order · Add multiple items and modify cart |
| 2 | **File Upload** | Upload a valid file · Visual snapshot of the upload page |
| 3 | **Login** | Invalid credentials rejection · Password field masking · Placeholder text · Header visibility |
| 4 | **Invalid Shipping Address** | Validation errors on every empty shipping address detail |
| 5 | **Contact Us** | Contact page accessible from the login page |
| 6 | **Shopping Cart restriction** | User can not add more than 1 item of the same kind |


## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** = v22.17.1

## Getting Started (Run Locally)

Follow these steps to clone the project and run the tests on your machine.

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rusola/QA-Automation-Code-Challenge-Playwright.git
cd playwright_netlify
```

### Step 2 — Open the project in your editor

Open the cloned folder in any editor of your choice. For example, if you use Visual Studio Code, you can run:

```bash
code .
```

### Step 3 — Install Node dependencies

This installs all required packages listed in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4 — Install Playwright browsers

This downloads the browsers Playwright needs to run tests (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit):

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Step 5 — Run all tests and open the report

This single command runs the full test suite and immediately opens the HTML report in your browser when done:

```bash
npm run test:report
```

To stop you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Running Tests

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run test:report` | All tests (headless) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | E2E suite only |
| `npm run test:smoke` | Smoke tests (`@smoke` tag) |
| `npm run test:headed` | All tests with browser visible |
| `npm run test:ui` | Interactive Playwright UI mode |

## Framework

- **Playwright** `^1.58.2`
- **ESLint + Prettier** — linting and formatting enforced via Husky pre-commit hook
- Browser: **Chromium** (Desktop Chrome, 1920×1080)
- Reports: **HTML** (`playwright-report/`), **JSON** and **JUnit** (`test-results/`)
- The tests are written in JavaScript, but I added a fixtures.d.ts file to provide type definitions so the editor can offer navigation.
- The `potential setup` project was added only in case the site supports saving the storage state in the future. In the current setup, the auth test runs and is ready to save the storage state, it can be disabled by commenting out `potential setup` project in playwright.config.js.
- The test tagged "@screenshot" runs only in Chrome. Therefore, after execution you should have 32 tests run in total: 11 in Chrome, 10 in Firefox, 10 in Safari, plus 1 setup test.


## How did I test Shopping Cart?

Test 1.2 verifies that a user can add multiple items to the shopping cart. Before adding each item, the test checks all product information — name, price, image, and add to cart button - to make sure what is displayed on the page matches the expected test data. After adding all items, the test verifies that each item appears in the cart with the correct price, quantity, and a REMOVE button. Ten the test confirms that the total price in the cart is calculated correctly based on the sum of all added items.

The test removes one item from the cart and verifies that both the cart row count and the total price update correctly to reflect the removal.

In addition, the test checks that the **ADD TO CART** button changes its background color when the user hovers over it, confirming that the hover state is visually applied.

Test #6. For testing purposes, I treated the existing website behavior as the requirement: the system allows to add only one item of a specific product to the cart. The test verifies that the user can see a browser alert message about this restriction.

## How did I test login (except happy flow)?

Test #3. I tested **valid username and invalid password** to make sure the system correctly rejects a login when the user exists but the password is wrong.

I do **not test invalid username with a valid password** because there are only two possible situations for that scenario.  
First, the account does **not exist**, so there is nothing meaningful to test.  
Second, the account **exists but belongs to another user**. In that case, my password would still be incorrect for that account, which is already covered by the **valid username + invalid password** test.

I also do **not test invalid username and invalid password**, because these conditions are already covered. The invalid password case is already tested, and testing an non-existing username does not add additional value.

I also verified that the **password field has type `password`**, which ensures that the password input is **masked with asterisks (hidden characters)** when the user types it.

I do **not test empty username and empty password separately**, because that would only reveal a completely broken validation. If validation were broken, the issue would already be detected when testing **invalid password**, since the system should reject incorrect credentials.

For this reason, an **empty password is considered part of the invalid password equivalence class**. Different invalid password values (including empty values) are **randomly selected from this class in different test runs**.

I use **labels as locators** when finding elements on the login page. This approach automatically verifies that the **label text is correct** and also confirms the **presence of a proper label for accessibility**. 

## How did I test for Shipping Address, Contact Us?

Test Case #4 verifies that each field in the shipping address form shows a validation error if it is left empty by the user.

Test Case #5 verifies that the user can contact support for assistance if they have questions about their order.

Tests are run in **multiple browsers**.

## File upload page testing

Test #2.1 checks the functionality, and test #2.2 verifies the layout of the elements using Playwright’s built-in screenshot comparison feature.
